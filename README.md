# Gendercoder app

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

There is a [very handy r package that codes free-text gender into usable
categories](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gendercoder) (while
preserving diversity).

My thinking is that there’s a group of analysts, that can’t use the
functions directly, maybe they’re SPSS or STATA users. If we think it
better that they collect free-text data and code it, we ought to make it
an option. I can’t repackage gendercoder for those languages, but I can
in principle make a shiny app that works with those data formats.

This repo will contain that shiny app.

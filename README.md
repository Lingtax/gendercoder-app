# Gendercoder app

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

There is a [very handy r package that codes free-text gender into usable
categories](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gendercoder) (while
preserving diversity).

There’s a group of analysts that can’t use the gendercoder package
directly (maybe they’re SPSS or STATA users). If we think it better that
they collect free-text data and code it, we ought to make it an option.
Since I can’t repackage gendercoder for those languages, but I can in
principle make a shiny app that works with those data formats, here it
is.
